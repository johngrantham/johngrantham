## [Learning AWS Serverless Course](https://builder.johng.org/courses/learning-aws-serverless)

This course steps you through designing and building secure, high-performance services using the AWS serverless stack. Along the way you'll also learn to use the tools and supporting services for deployment and monitoring necessary to support real production workloads. 

The sample code offered for this course are two variants of the Connected Car solution. This solution is a service for an imagined car manufacturer that supports real-time vehicle event reporting, customer service bookings via smart phone, and administration of customers, vehicles, time slots, and appointments.

Here are links to more information about the two variants of this solution:
